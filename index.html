<h2>My Take away</h2>
<p>I saw this sign while walking to the starbucks across the street from my new dorm. As im about to enter, the bold white letters catch my attention. “Art is the only way to runaway without leaving home” I think I connected to this for a multitude of reasons. For one, im an artist. I would say I use my art as both a hobby and a therapy session. I could (and literally have) start creating something at 11:00am and the next thing I know its almost midnight. Its almost as if I enter a state of such intense focus, nothing else in the world exists. Its just me and my pencil. I think thats what I love the most about art, I could make anything I want, for however long I want, without anyone elses opinion. Personally, I have an incredibly hard time explaining my emotions to people. However with my art I don’t have to use my words, it doesn’t even have to make sense to anyone else. The only person it has to be approved of is myself. Instead of feeling stuck in my head when trying to verbally express myself, I just move my hand and create something that makes me feel heard. Thats how I runaway without having to move at all.
